Some things you might consider editing the website to say.

# Front page

There's a lot of filler content here.

# Culled from the FAQ

Questions you might want to answer, for which we removed GPH-specific answers:

- Do I need to have an X-person team?
- How many puzzles will there be? ("Around X." for a round number X.)
- What exactly happens when the hunt ends? (You can use e.g. `{% format_time end_time '%B %d' %}` in the template.)
- Can I write code that interacts with the puzzles / server?
- Who's running this hunt?
- Are there any prizes?
- Is there a physical component to the hunt? Will I ever need to be in a particular location to solve a puzzle?
- Is there a registration deadline?

# Archive

There's an archive page where you can link to past hunts and such, but you can just delete the link and the page if you don't have anything like that.
