_Apologies for the runaround. I know I put you through many trials, and even dished out a few **quips** along the way, but I had to see if you're ready. Prove me right, and I'll shine a light on how to activate **The Lantern**._

*Things I overheard during your heist...* 


“This monochrome painting is a bit too abstract for my taste. And why did they go with this piece over the other versions?”  

“Ugh, crypto bros and their rocket emojis. Why do they always use this number of them in their sayings?”  

“We should pay our respects to those before us. Remind me, how many flags have five letters?”  

“I'm so hungry I could pig out. But who's that weird customer that prefers ziti?”  

“I'm ready to take down any legendary monster coming my way! How many arms did that statue I defeated have again?”  

“My car's algorithm seems to be on the fritz. Does it even register how many rows or columns the stop sign has?”  

“Sold! Wait, who just snagged The Lonely Bookkeeper?”  

“'I'm loving this ancient dance! But what do you think that Aztec warrior is going to do with that number of arrows?”  

“This bot could use a better training model. If it did, maybe it would know how many points mik and mak are worth?”  

"I can't wait to get in! But what's with the last digit on my ticket number?"  

“This stream seems to go on forever. I wonder how many temples I'll be able to visit around here?”  

“This is such a friendly group of employees. Why would this many of them be considered marks?”  

“Does anyone need this many keys? Why not just use The Cool Key for everything?”  

“Nothing like going on a safari from the comfort of a bench! Do you think that many polar bears and elephants would cause an uproar?”  

“Ick, I can't stand the way they slither in this nest! If I stay on the spot three rows down on the left, can they still reach me?”  

“I just wanted a convenient meal, but this order total is massive! What was the amount in the top right corner again?”  

“Try not to get buried underneath all these cubes! Should we pull the bottom left one out first?”  

“I don't understand a word this team is saying to each other. Maybe it's due to the hour they sent their messages out?”
